# LeadGen AI: Caprae Capital AI-Readiness Challenge Report

## Approach
LeadGen AI was developed to demonstrate how AI can drive real-world business impact in lead generation. The tool focuses on prioritizing high-value leads, streamlining sales workflows, and providing actionable insightsâ€”all within a modern, user-friendly interface.

## Model Selection & Data Processing
- **Lead Scoring:** A rule-based scoring system simulates AI-driven prioritization, rewarding leads with relevant categories (e.g., AI, Blockchain, FinTech) and keyword matches. In production, this could be replaced with a machine learning model (e.g., scikit-learn, transformers) trained on historical sales data.
- **Deduplication & Enrichment:** The backend removes duplicate companies and enriches each lead with simulated sentiment and category tags.
- **Data Flow:** User inputs (industry, location, keywords) are used to filter and score leads, which are then presented in a sortable, filterable table.

## Performance Evaluation
- **Responsiveness:** The tool delivers instant results and supports filtering and exporting without page reloads.
- **Data Quality:** Deduplication and enrichment logic ensure only unique, relevant leads are shown.
- **Scalability:** The architecture (FastAPI + modular backend) is designed for easy extension to real scraping and AI models.

## Design Rationale
- **Business Alignment:** The tool helps sales teams focus on high-impact leads, minimizing noise and maximizing conversion potential.
- **User Experience:** Clean, modern UI with intuitive filters, tooltips, and badges for high-value leads. Export and CRM integration features support real sales workflows.
- **Technical Sophistication:** Demonstrates deduplication, enrichment, and scoring logic, with clear stubs for future AI and scraping enhancements.
- **Ethical Considerations:** The tool is built for ethical data use, with a clear note on responsible scraping.

## Value & Next Steps
LeadGen AI aligns with Caprae Capital's mission to empower businesses post-acquisition through practical AI. With further development (real scraping, ML scoring, CRM integration), it can become a cornerstone for data-driven sales enablement.
